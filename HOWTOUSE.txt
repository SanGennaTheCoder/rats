Run the tool by executing the following command in your terminal:

rats

The program will print a random ASCII art block from the art.txt file.

You can customize the ASCII art displayed by editing the art.txt file located in the installation directory.

Each ASCII art block should be separated by a line containing only ---. For example:

[insert ASCII art of a cat here]
---
[insert ASCII art of a dog here]

Make sure the separator --- is on its own line.
